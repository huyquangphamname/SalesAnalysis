# Sales Analysis Capstone Project with Python and Quarto
![Sales Analysis Capstone Project with Python and Quarto](/Unlocking%20Sales%20Insights-3.png)
Welcome to the Sales Analysis Capstone Project! This project serves as a beginner-friendly, hands-on walkthrough of data science tasks aimed at uncovering retail sales insights. It is designed to help users leverage Python and Quarto for data analysis, visualization, and reporting.

## Project Overview
In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing sales data from a retail store. We will perform *data cleaning*,* exploratory data analysis*, and *visualization* to uncover insights about the store's sales performance. We will also create interactive visualizations and a report summarizing our findings.

The goal of this capstone project is to explore retail sales data and derive actionable insights by examining:
1. Seasonal and trend impacts on sales
2. City and district-based sales patterns
3. Sales behaviors during seasonal spike (Black Friday, cyber Monday, Christmas, etc.)


Using Python for data analysis and Quarto for documentation, this project enables us to:
- Analyze data across different time periods and locations.
- Visualize findings through meaningful dashboards.
- Gain insights for better retail strategy planning.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Quarto**: An open-source publishing system ideal for creating documentation that combines code, text, and visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For data handling and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries used for creating visualizations to highlight sales trends.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The interactive environment for coding and testing data analyses.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, formatting, and organizing sales data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Uncovering patterns and trends in the data.
- **Report Generation**: Using Quarto to document findings and create a shareable report.
- **Dashboard Development**: On-going to create insightful visualizations for store-level, district-level, and new store analyses.

## Dashboard Prototype
1. **Store Sales Overview**
- **Purpose**: To provide a summary of store-level performance, with metrics like total sales, variance, and average sales per unit.
- **Visuals**: Displays sales distributions, comparisons, and sales per store type.
2. **District Monthly Sales**
- **Purpose**: To analyze sales at a district level, focusing on month-over-month changes and variances.
- **Visuals**: Monthly sales breakdown, trend analysis, and variance charts by district.
3. **New Stores Analysis**
- **Purpose**: To examine the performance of newly opened stores, including sales per square foot and geographical distribution.
- **Visuals**: Map visualizations, monthly sales performance, and sales by store area.

## Data Dictionary and Key Measures
The project relies on a structured retail dataset with key fields such as `DistrictID`, `ItemID`, `LocationID`, `OpenDate`, and various sales metrics. These fields help us answer core analytical questions, such as comparing year-over-year sales growth, identifying top-selling items, and evaluating regional performance.

**Key Measures**:
- Markdown and Regular Sales: Summing up sales by category.
- Total Sales: The combination of Markdown and Regular Sales.
- Sales Variance: Tracking change in sales from month to month.

**Challenges and Learnings**:
Creating accurate data visualizations and aligning time-series data were key challenges in this project. For instance, organizing store openings chronologically and calculating district-level trends required precise data management. Overcoming these challenges enhanced understanding of retail sales analytics and improved data visualization skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook to follow along with the data analysis steps.
4. Generate the final report using Quarto.

## Conclusion
This Sales Analysis Capstone Project is a foundational exercise in understanding retail data, creating interactive visualizations, and documenting findings for stakeholders. Through this project, we aim to make data-driven decisions more accessible, especially for those starting out in data science.
