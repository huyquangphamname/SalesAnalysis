# 1. Executive Summary
This proposal presents a strategic approach to enhancing my role as a Process Optimization Engineer at Nam Thuan, with an emphasis on driving measurable improvements in quality, operational efficiency, and cost savings. To align compensation with the responsibilities and requirements of this role, I propose a salary adjustment from **12,000,000 VND to 14,000,000 VND gross per month**. My past achievements demonstrate a proven ability to deliver impact, such as **reducing defect rates by 15%** and **increasing production efficiency by 20%** through targeted process optimizations.


### Long-Term Vision:
I aim to establish a comprehensive quality management framework at Nam Thuan, including advanced data analytics for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance, to ensure sustained process excellence and operational resilience.

### Expected Outcomes:
1. **Quality Improvements**: Achieve a further **10% reduction in defect rates** and **15% improvement in process consistency** within the first year.
2. **Enhanced Team Engagement**: Foster a continuous improvement culture, with a target of increasing team participation in quality initiatives by 30%.
3. **Cost Savings**: Reduce production costs through improved scrap management and preventive maintenance, with a projected savings of **10% in material waste costs**.

# 2. Rationale for the Proposal

## A. Industry Standards and Competitive Compensation
- **Industry Benchmarks**: According to the 2024 Compensation Best Practices report from **Payscale** and other resources like **Robert Walters**, roles that require frequent travel and advanced technical skills, such as Process Optimization Engineers, typically offer **15-30% higher base salaries** compared to similar non-travel rolee. This additional compensation reflects the higher responsibility and flexibility demands (Payscale, 2024).
- **Local Market**: Research on VietnamWorks and Navigos Search reveals that Process Optimization Engineers in the Vietnamese manufacturing sector are generally compensated in the **15-25 million VND** range when travel and cross-functional responsibilities are involved (VietnamWorks, Navigos Search). Aligning Nam Thuan’s compensation package to this standard ensures the retention of skilled talent critical for meeting operational and strategic goals.


## B. Addressing Specific Pain Points
- **Production Bottlenecks**: As bottlenecks affect productivity and lead times, timely interventions can prevent significant delays and improve throughput.
- **High Scrap Levels**: My expertise in implementing quality management techniques, such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), directly addresses high scrap rates, enhancing production efficiency and reducing costs.


## C. Long-Term Commitment to Process Improvement Goals
- **Continuous Improvement**: Developing preventive maintenance projects and quality control frameworks that address recurring issues will ultimately increase productivity.
- **Employee Retention and Development**: A competitive compensation package supports this commitment, aligning my contributions with Nam Thuan’s long-term growth objectives, including potential digital transformation initiatives.
