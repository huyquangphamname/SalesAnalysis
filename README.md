Welcome to the Sales Analysis Capstone Project! This project is a beginner-friendly, hands-on walkthrough of data science tasks aimed at uncovering retail sales insights. It is designed to help users leverage Python and Quarto for data analysis, visualization, and reporting.

## Goals:

- Explore retail sales data and derive actionable insights
- Analyze seasonal and trend impacts on sales
- Identify city and district-based sales patterns
- Understand sales behaviors during high-traffic events (e.g., Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas)

**Objectives**: Using Python and Quarto, we will:

1. Analyze data across various time periods and locations
2. Visualize findings with meaningful dashboards
3. Gain insights for better retail strategy planning

**Tools and Technologies**

- **Python:** Primary language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Quarto:** For creating shareable reports with combined code, text, and visualizations.
- **Pandas:** For efficient data handling and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Libraries used for creating sales trend visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The interactive environment for data analysis.
Project Structure

## Data Preparation: Cleaning, formatting, and organizing sales data.
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Discovering patterns and trends.
2. **Report Generation:** Documenting findings using Quarto for a shareable report.
3. **Dashboard Development:** Prototyping visualizations for store-level, district-level, and new store analyses.

# Dashboard Prototype

1. **Store Sales Overview**
- **Purpose:** Provides a summary of store-level performance, including total sales, variance, and average sales per unit.
- **Visuals:** Sales distributions, comparisons, and sales per store type.
2. **District Monthly Sales**
- **Purpose:** Analyzes sales at the district level, focusing on month-over-month changes and variances.
- **Visuals:** Monthly sales breakdown, trend analysis, and variance charts by district.
3. **New Stores Analysis**
- **Purpose:** Examines the performance of newly opened stores, covering metrics like sales per square foot and geographic distribution.
- **Visuals:** Map visualizations, monthly sales, and sales by store area.

## Data Dictionary and Key Measures 
This project uses a retail dataset with key fields such as DistrictID, ItemID, LocationID, OpenDate, and various sales metrics. These fields enable analysis across multiple dimensions:

**Markdown and Regular Sales:** - _Summed up by category_.
- **Total Sales:** Combination of Markdown and Regular Sales.
- **Sales Variance:** Month-over-month and year-over-year changes.
- **Regional Store Performance:** Products are distributed evenly throughout the year while the regional show the impacts on sales perfomance due to the city demographic attribution.

**Challenges and Learnings Key challenges included:**

1. Creating accurate data visualizations and aligning time-series data
2. Managing store openings chronologically
3. Calculating district-level trends
4. Overcoming these challenges improved data management and visualization skills and deepened understanding of retail sales analytics.
