    "# Sales Data Analysis Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Thi individual reports tracks the instructional video titled [\"Solving real world data science tasks with Python Pandas!\"](https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks.git) by [Keith Galli](https://youtu.be/eMOA1pPVUc4?si=-UXWLdSFktCLWSh5). Through power of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/vscode/). Utilizing the capabilities of Quarto, I present the final product of a story telling report designed to showcase practices and engage the audience seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this 'Sales Data Analysis,' I apply foundational exploratory data skills in data science (using Python Pandas and Matplotlib) to follow the instructional material within a single *Jupyter notebook* file. The goal is to familiarize myself with **multiple files** of monthly records (*./Sales_Data*) and consolidate them into one **.csv** file. By learning through hands-on experience, I employ critical thinking and create a notebook that highlights significant insights while incorporating data visualization to impact the electronic retail sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the competitive retail landscape, data is essential for understanding customer preferences and refining sales strategies. Various insights are critical for business decisions, including sales trends over time and standout products.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data reveals an inverse relationship between 'Sale Quantity' and 'Price Each', indicating that consumers tend to purchase more affordable items, such as accessories, rather than high-cost items like laptops and household electronics. The correlation between low-priced products and their higher sales volume suggests the effectiveness of comparing average prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1: Subplot of price each items over the quantity of products in total](/Output/PriceQuantityComparision.png){fig-alt=\"A bar chart illustrating the number of orders per product with an overlaid line plot of average price for each item. The green bars represent quantity ordered, while the blue line indicates average price in dollars. This visualization helps identify popular items and their price points, illustrating that lower-priced items like batteries have higher sales volumes, while premium products like the MacBook Pro see fewer orders.\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions in this chart include office products like the MacBook Pro and ThinkPad, which may reflect other factors influencing customer demand or the investment cycle in new products. The insights derived from the sales data, inspired by Keith Galli's tutorial, are crucial for uncovering trends such as peak sales periods, best-selling products, and strategies to enhance sales.\n",
    "### a/ Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The data sources depict set of data in 12 months of electrical stores named \"Keith's SuperDuper cool electronics\". The folder 'data' contains 12 separate `.csv` files each representing sales data from different stores across the months of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b/ Data Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video, the initial data integration resulted in a single unified `.csv` file that combines the 12 months of sales data. The merging process reads files ending with `.csv`. The author/youtuber's rationale is to create a comprehensive dataset for detailed analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important practice involves importing the necessary libraries."
