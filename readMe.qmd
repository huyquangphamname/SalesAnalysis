# Sales Data Analysis Capstone Project with Python and Quarto

Welcome to the Sales Analysis Capstone Project! This project is a beginner-friendly, hands-on walkthrough of data science tasks aimed at uncovering retail sales insights. It is designed to help users leverage Python and Quarto for data analysis, visualization, and reporting.

## Goals:
- Explore retail sales data and derive actionable insights
- Analyze seasonal and trend impacts on sales
- Identify city and district-based sales patterns
- Understand sales behaviors during high-traffic events (e.g., Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas)

## Objectives:
Using Python and Quarto, we will:
- Analyze data across various time periods and locations
- Visualize findings with meaningful dashboards
- Gain insights for better retail strategy planning

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Quarto**: For creating shareable reports with combined code, text, and visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data handling and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries used for creating sales trend visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The interactive environment for data analysis.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, formatting, and organizing sales data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Discovering patterns and trends.
- **Report Generation**: Documenting findings using Quarto for a shareable report.
- **Dashboard Development**: Prototyping visualizations for store-level, district-level, and new store analyses.

## Dashboard Prototype
1. **Store Sales Overview**
    - **Purpose**: To provide a summary of store-level performance, including total sales, variance, and average sales per unit.
    - **Visuals**: Sales distributions, comparisons, and sales per store type.
2. **District Monthly Sales**
    - **Purpose**: To analyze sales at the district level, focusing on month-over-month changes and variances.
    - **Visuals**: Monthly sales breakdown, trend analysis, and variance charts by district.
3. **New Stores Analysis**
    - **Purpose**: To examine the performance of newly opened stores, covering metrics like sales per square foot and geographic distribution.
    - **Visuals**: Map visualizations, monthly sales, and sales by store area.

## Data Dictionary and Key Measures
This project uses a retail dataset with key fields such as `DistrictID`, `ItemID`, `LocationID`, `OpenDate`, and various sales metrics. These fields enable analysis across multiple dimensions, such as:
- **Markdown and Regular Sales**: Summed up by category.
- **Total Sales**: Combination of Markdown and Regular Sales.
- **Sales Variance**: Month-over-month and year-over-year changes.
- **Sales per Square Foot**: Efficiency metric calculated by dividing total sales by store area.

## Challenges and Learnings
Key challenges included:
- Creating accurate data visualizations and aligning time-series data
- Managing store openings chronologically
- Calculating district-level trends

Overcoming these challenges improved data management and visualization skills and deepened understanding of retail sales analytics.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis.
4. Generate the final report using Quarto.

## Conclusion
This Sales Analysis Capstone Project is an excellent introduction to retail data analysis, with interactive visualizations and documentation for stakeholder presentations. Through this project, we aim to make data-driven decisions more accessible, especially for those new to data science.
